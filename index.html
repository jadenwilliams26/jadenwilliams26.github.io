      <p>Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has been both a personal milestone and a professional transformation. Over the course of my studies, I have not only deepened my technical expertise but also learned how to present my abilities in a way that clearly demonstrates my readiness for the computer science field. This portfolio is the culmination of years of structured learning, hands-on problem-solving, and iterative project development, each artifact reflecting both my growth and my adaptability.

Showcasing Strengths and Shaping Goals

Throughout my coursework, I learned to approach problems as opportunities for innovation rather than obstacles. Every project, whether an academic assignment or a personal undertaking, strengthened my ability to think critically, design systematically, and implement robust solutions. The process of curating and enhancing artifacts for my ePortfolio sharpened my skills in modular software design, algorithm optimization, database management, and secure coding practices.

My professional goals are rooted in developing solutions that are both technically sound and user-focused. This means ensuring that my software is maintainable, scalable, and resilient while remaining approachable for end users. This philosophy is reflected throughout the artifacts I have chosen — each enhancement demonstrates a deliberate step toward aligning functionality with usability.

Collaboration and Communication

My program experience taught me that collaboration is not simply dividing tasks but aligning perspectives to solve complex problems. I have contributed to and led team projects where success depended on maintaining clear communication, documenting processes, and adapting to evolving requirements. Working with both technical peers and non-technical stakeholders taught me how to translate complex technical concepts into accessible language, ensuring everyone involved understands the scope, progress, and trade-offs of a project.

Technical Expertise

Data Structures and Algorithms: I have applied these fundamentals in designing efficient, reliable solutions for real-time systems. For example, I implemented menu navigation and alert systems in hardware projects using optimized state management and decision logic.

Software Engineering: My development process incorporates modularity, clean architecture, and thorough documentation. I have implemented full object-oriented designs in both academic and personal projects to ensure scalability and maintainability.

Databases: I have integrated both SQL and NoSQL solutions, such as MongoDB, into applications, ensuring that data is efficiently structured and retrieved to meet specific use cases.

Security: I understand the importance of secure coding practices, including input validation, sanitization, and secure data handling. I applied these principles when building applications that interact with hardware and databases.

Portfolio Cohesion

The artifacts in this ePortfolio fit together to tell a complete story of my capabilities: from foundational software design to advanced algorithmic thinking and finally to database integration. The featured thermostat project, enhanced across three categories, exemplifies my ability to plan, build, and evolve a solution through multiple layers of technical improvement. Together, these artifacts present not just isolated skills but an integrated skill set — one that can adapt to different challenges and technologies in the field.

This ePortfolio is not simply a record of past work; it is a representation of my readiness to contribute meaningfully to the computer science profession. The skills demonstrated here — technical, collaborative, and communicative — form the foundation of my professional identity and will continue to evolve as I advance in my career.</p>

    <!-- Combined Narrative -->
    <section>
      <h2>Combined Narrative</h2>
      <p>Briefly describe the artifact.
The artifact is a Python-based thermostat system designed for a reptile enclosure. It was originally developed in early 2025 as a functional temperature and humidity controller using a Raspberry Pi, DHT22 sensor, heater, and misting system. Over the course of this project, the system was significantly enhanced in three stages: software design and engineering improvements (Category One), advanced algorithm and data structure integration (Category Two), and MongoDB database integration for dynamic setpoint retrieval (Category Three).

Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio.
This project was selected for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design, improve, and extend a real-world IoT solution through multiple layers of development. It showcases my skills in structured software design, hardware integration, GPIO-based input handling, algorithmic problem-solving, and database-driven customization. Across the three enhancement stages, I applied best practices in class-based architecture, efficient data handling, and database interaction — all while managing hardware components. The artifact’s progression clearly reflects growth in both coding quality and system functionality, making it an excellent representation of my software development capabilities.

How was the artifact improved?

Category One: Software Design and Engineering — Refactored the code into a modular, class-based architecture with Thermostat, Controller, and DisplayManager classes. Added structured error handling, improved commenting, and clearer separation of responsibilities for maintainability and scalability.

Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures — Introduced GPIO-based menu navigation using physical buttons for adjusting temperature and humidity setpoints. Implemented algorithmic logic for LED-based environmental alerts, improving real-time responsiveness to sensor readings.

Category Three: Databases — Integrated a local MongoDB database to store species-specific temperature and humidity requirements. The system now automatically pulls correct setpoints when a species is selected, eliminating the need for manual reconfiguration and making the system more adaptable to various reptile species.

Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One?
Yes. The enhancements addressed planned course outcomes, including designing and evaluating computing solutions, demonstrating innovative techniques and tools, and creating software that meets specific industry needs. The database integration also aligned with outcomes related to managing data effectively and ensuring solutions are adaptable to future requirements.

Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact.
Enhancing this artifact taught me the importance of planning for modularity early in development. While adding new features, I learned how clear class responsibilities and well-documented code help streamline the integration of new functionalities — especially when hardware components are involved. The GPIO-based input system required careful algorithmic planning to prevent misreads and ensure user-friendliness. Integrating MongoDB added another layer of complexity, as I had to design data structures that were intuitive, scalable, and reliable for retrieving species-specific settings.

The biggest challenges were ensuring smooth hardware/software interaction, particularly when switching between modes and updating setpoints in real time, and maintaining clean communication between the database and the thermostat logic. Overcoming these obstacles strengthened my ability to design full-stack IoT systems and deepened my understanding of how to merge software engineering principles with physical device control.</p>
