            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout my Computer Science program, I have built a wide range of technical and professional skills that directly prepare me to excel in the software development field. Developing my ePortfolio has given me an opportunity to showcase these strengths and demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and enhance complete software solutions.

            <h2>Combined Narrative</h2>
            <p>
                This ePortfolio contains an enhanced artifact that evolved across three distinct competency areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. The artifact is a Python-based thermostat system originally developed for CS350, which I expanded to include environmental controls for a reptile breeding application. It integrates sensor readings, GPIO control, setpoint management, and MongoDB-based configuration retrieval.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Software Design and Engineering phase, I focused on modularity, creating distinct classes such as <code>DisplayManager</code>, <code>Controller</code>, and <code>Thermostat</code>. This improved maintainability and readability, showcasing my skills in designing structured, reusable code. In the Algorithms and Data Structures phase, I implemented GPIO button inputs for adjusting temperature and humidity setpoints in real-time, along with LED status indicators for alert conditions. This demonstrated my ability to apply control flow, state management, and data manipulation techniques in a hardware-interfaced environment. Finally, in the Database phase, I integrated a local MongoDB database to automatically retrieve species-specific setpoints upon selection, reflecting my ability to work with persistent storage and dynamic system configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through these enhancements, I met my planned course outcomes, including applying software design principles, implementing algorithmic solutions, and integrating database functionality into a working system. Each phase deepened my understanding of the relevant concepts: object-oriented design in phase one, event-driven programming in phase two, and database querying in phase three.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process required balancing hardware constraints with software flexibility. I learned to account for input debounce, GPIO timing, and real-time feedback, while also ensuring database integration did not interrupt control loop performance. The main challenge was ensuring seamless communication between hardware, algorithms, and database logic without introducing latency or instability. Overcoming these issues strengthened my problem-solving skills and reinforced the value of modular, testable code.

            <h2>Category One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
            <p>
                The artifact is a Python-based environmental control system designed for a reptile breeder, originally created in CS350 and enhanced for this project. It uses modular class-based design to manage hardware components, including a DHT22 sensor, heater, misting device, LEDs, and buttons. The initial enhancements focused on creating a maintainable and scalable structure, implementing clear separation of concerns, and preparing the code for future integration of additional features.
            </p>
            <p>
                I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to structure complex software systems for both clarity and expansion. The implementation of <code>DisplayManager</code>, <code>Controller</code>, and <code>Thermostat</code> classes reflects my understanding of software engineering best practices. By separating display logic, hardware control, and business logic, I ensured that each component could be tested and maintained independently. The improvements included adding comments, refactoring repetitive code, and ensuring readiness for further enhancements.
            </p>
            <p>
                These enhancements met my planned outcomes for Module One by showing my ability to apply object-oriented design principles to a hardware-software integrated system. I learned the value of designing with future integration in mind, which reduced the complexity of later adding algorithmic and database features. The challenge was mapping out a clean architecture while still maintaining compatibility with the original CS350 functionality.

            <h2>Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
            <p>
                In the second enhancement phase, I expanded the artifact by implementing real-time setpoint adjustment using physical buttons connected via GPIO. The <code>BUTTON_MODE</code>, <code>BUTTON_UP</code>, and <code>BUTTON_DOWN</code> pins allow the user to cycle between temperature and humidity adjustment modes and increment or decrement the setpoints. I also incorporated <code>RED_LED</code> and <code>BLUE_LED</code> indicators to signal alert conditions, such as when readings deviate from desired ranges.
            </p>
            <p>
                This enhancement was chosen because it illustrates my ability to apply algorithms and data structures to hardware-interfaced applications. I implemented efficient control loops that handle input debouncing, state tracking, and conditional logic for alerts. The system’s ability to update setpoints in-memory without interrupting the control process demonstrates strong event-driven programming skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I met my Module One course outcomes by showcasing my capability to design algorithms that interact with hardware in real-time while maintaining reliability. I learned to manage state efficiently and ensure responsiveness, even under the constraints of GPIO input timing. The primary challenge was ensuring smooth transitions between modes and avoiding false inputs due to button bounce, which I resolved through software debouncing techniques.

            <h2>Category Three: Databases</h2>
            <p>
                In the final enhancement, I integrated a local MongoDB database to store and retrieve species-specific temperature and humidity setpoints. When a species is selected in the system, the thermostat automatically queries the database and applies the retrieved setpoints without requiring manual configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                This enhancement highlights my database integration skills, including connecting to MongoDB, executing queries, and incorporating retrieved data into the system’s operational logic. It showcases my ability to combine persistent data storage with hardware control, allowing the system to adapt dynamically to different operational requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The enhancement fulfilled my planned course outcomes by demonstrating proficiency in database management and its application within a larger software-hardware system. I learned how to optimize database queries to minimize latency and ensure seamless integration with real-time control processes. The main challenge was ensuring that the database access did not interrupt the timing-sensitive GPIO control loop, which I solved by loading setpoints before initiating the main control cycle.
